## Clare Pinder		Ruby | Javascript | Python | front-end | SQL

For eight years, I’ve enjoyed diverse roles as a Government Economist. While I appreciate the variety, I’m happiest at work building analytical models to solve logic-based problems. Even when a junior economist, I built a complex model in my own time to escape time-consuming manual data processing, which changed the way the Government analyses climate targets. 
 
Outside work, I love to create things. Since I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by taking things apart and putting them back together again, and I love to teach myself new skills. I’m a perfectionist about style and formatting which means I write code quickly and systematically, picking up errors. I also spend time on simple art and design and enjoy the crossover with programming and the functional design space.
 
I’m looking for a role in in a consultancy or tech company where I can learn from experts on a variety of projects and quickly build a range of competence and experience. I’m interested in building both my back-end and front-end development skills, given my passions for both maths and design.

## Skills

#### Quantitative skills

I have strong quantitative skills. I see the world in a very logical way which means I can break problems down into simple solutions that work for the user and for my computer.
- At Manchester Uni, I ranked fifth in my cohort with a First Class BSc in Quantitative Economics; and
- At UCL, I received 2 marks off distinction for my MSc thesis, using Stata to analyse the impact of a health policy using large healthcare datasets.

#### Teamwork and communication

I love working with people, in pairs and in teams (perhaps more than your typical coder). I enjoy bringing my enthusiasm about a project to a whole team as well as working out a problem together and learning from other perspectives. I have the perseverance to get things done and I keep going with a problem until it’s solved. I also pride myself on both my written and oral communication skills – working as a Government Economist for eight years has honed my ability to deliver clear, concise and persuasive communication to a range or audiences.

## Education

#### Jan 2019 – Apr 2019: Makers Academy
I’m currently working on my programming course at Makers Academy – I’ll provide more detail here as the course develops.
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Python
- RSpec, Jasmine, Pytest
- Final project: Ulima - Connect 4. A machine learning where we aimed to teach the computer to play Connect 4.
- Final assessment feedback: "This was a really excellent review. There wasn't one moment where I felt you were off-process: as a result, you were focussed, clear, and intentional. You identified the core problem rapidly, modelled it well, and designed and built a powerful but self-contained algorithm to solve the problem. Your debugging approaches seemed on point and your code was well-factored and thoughtful. It's hard to point out areas to improve within the context of Makers, but I have a hunch you might be interested in some aspects of functional programming – Haskell or Clojure being interesting routes into that."

## Experience

#### Nov 2010 – Jan 2019: Economist, (various Government Departments in London, see below) 
- Jan 2018 – Jan 2019: Economic Adviser, Department for Food, Environment & Rural Affairs
- Oct 2015 – Jan 2018: Economic Adviser, Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (formerly Department for Energy & Climate Change)
- Jun 2011 – Oct 2015: Assistant Economist, Committee on Climate Change
- Nov 2010 – Jun 2011: Assistant Economist, Office for National Statistics
##### Economist – roles and achievements:
- In these roles, I led many high profile economic analyses to determine the effectiveness of proposed environmental policies, for example for the recent announcement of a plastics tax.
- I built analytical models (typically in Excel) to undertake quantitative analysis of large and incomplete datasets to determine both monetary and non-monetary costs and benefits of proposed environmental policies. I did this both independently and delivering through my team. I researched and implemented innovative analytical techniques. 
- I managed projects, proactively bringing in Agile project management techniques into a traditional project management environment.
- I honed my oral and written communication skills through regularly presenting (to 100+ people), leading negotiation with the Treasury to agree funding, and briefing Ministers ensuring clear, concise and persuasive language.
- I have been rewarded with a year career break from Defra to do Makers Academy with the option to return if I choose (but I intend to find a job as a developer instead).

#### Nov 2013 – Aug 2014: Policy & Research Fellow / Economic Adviser, NGOs, Melbourne, Australia (career break from Committee on Climate Change, London, see below)
- Jun 2014 – Aug 2014: Economic Adviser, Australian Conservation Foundation. 
- Nov 2013 – Jul 2014: Policy and Research Fellow The Climate Institute, Melbourne
##### NGO work – roles and achievements:
- I led a study to understand the role carbon-removal technologies in achieving climate goals. I managed the project from start to finish including:
- Analysed data, synthesised literature and authored two reports, presenting complex material in a scientifically credible way while being accessible to non-experts.
- Led the engagement strategy including workshops to consult on early findings and presenting finished material at national conferences.
- Created blogs, videos, infographics and web material.
