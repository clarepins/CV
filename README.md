#### This CV: [Projects](https://github.com/clarepins/CV/blob/master/README.md#projects) | [Skills](https://github.com/clarepins/CV/blob/master/README.md#skills) | [Education](https://github.com/clarepins/CV/blob/master/README.md#education) | [Experience](https://github.com/clarepins/CV/blob/master/README.md#experience) | [Interests](https://github.com/clarepins/CV/blob/master/README.md#interests)

I am an energetic and ambitious **full stack junior developer**, looking for a role in an established consultancy or tech company where I can learn best practice from experts. I am keen to work on a variety of projects – building both backend and frontend given my passions for maths and design.

Before graduating from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) in May 2019, I enjoyed diverse roles for eight years as a **Government Economist**, ranging from leading negotiations with the Treasury to win funding, to building complex analytical models to estimate costs and benefits of high-profile environmental policies, to leading the impact assessment for smart appliance regulations. While I appreciated the variety, I was happiest at work using Excel and statistical software to solve logic-based problems, which led me to explore coding.

## Skills

### Quantitative skills

I have strong quantitative skills. I see the world in a very logical way which means I can break problems down into simple solutions that work for the user and for my computer.

- At Manchester Uni, I ranked **fifth in my cohort** with a First Class BSc in Quantitative Economics; and
- At UCL, I received **2 marks off distinction** for my MSc thesis, using Stata to analyse the impact of a health policy using large healthcare datasets.

### Teamwork and communication

I love working with people, in pairs and in teams. I enjoy bringing my enthusiasm about a project to a whole team as well as working out a problem together and learning from other perspectives. 

I also pride myself on both my written and oral communication skills – working as a Government Economist for eight years has honed my ability to deliver clear, concise and persuasive communication to a range of audiences.

## Education

### [![Makers Academy](https://github.com/clarepins/CV/blob/master/icons/makers-icon.jpg)](https://makers.tech/) Makers Academy (Jan – Apr 2019)
Highly selective 4 month intensive coding bootcamp.

Ruby | Rails | JavaScript |  Python |  Sinatra | HTML  | CSS | Materialize | PostgreSQL | RSpec | Jasmine | Pytest | Capybara

- Makers does not assign a grade or mark to its students, but I received the following **[feedback](https://github.com/clarepins/CV/blob/master/clare-pinder-makers-feedback.pdf) for my final assessment**: *"This was a really excellent review. There wasn't one moment where I felt you were off-process: as a result, you were focussed, clear, and intentional. You identified the core problem rapidly, modelled it well, and designed and built a powerful but self-contained algorithm to solve the problem. Your debugging approaches seemed on point and your code was well-factored and thoughtful. It's hard to point out areas to improve within the context of Makers, but I have a hunch you might be interested in some aspects of functional programming..."*
- **Final project**: [Ulima – Connect 4](https://www.facebook.com/MakersAcademy/videos/1034352356758922/?&t=809). A machine learning project where we aimed to teach the computer to play Connect 4. Python | Behave | OpenAI Gym | Tensorflow | Keras | PyGame
- All coding adhered to these **principles**: Test Driven Development (TDD), Object Oriented Principles (OOP), Model View Controller (MVC), Domain Driven Design (DDD), 
Agile & eXtreme Programming values

## Experience

#### Economic Adviser, various Government Departments (2010 – 2019)
- Head of Fiscal Analysis, [Department for Food, Environment & Rural Affairs](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs) (Jan 2018 – Jan 2019)
- Smart Energy Analyst, [Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy) (Oct 2015 – Jan 2018)
- Power Sector, [Committee on Climate Change](https://www.theccc.org.uk/) (Jun 2011 – Oct 2015)
- Health Sector Productivity, [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) (Nov 2010 – Jun 2011)

In these roles, I led many high profile economic analyses to determine the effectiveness of proposed environmental policies. For example, preparing for future grid impacts of [electric vehicles](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/748296/delivering-clean-growth.pdf), regulating cybersecurity & interoperability of [smart appliances](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/690806/SmartAppliancesConsultationStageIA-.pdf), and assessing cost impacts to society of innovative [renewable technologies](https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/CCC-Prog-Rep-Book_singles_web_1.pdf).

- Built analytical models to ascertain both monetary and non-monetary costs and benefits of proposed environmental policies. Both independently and delivering through my team. 
- Managed projects, proactively bringing in Agile project management techniques into a traditional project management environment.
- Honed oral and written communication skills through regularly presenting (to 100+ people), leading negotiation with the Treasury to agree funding, and briefing Ministers ensuring clear, concise and persuasive language.
- Was rewarded with a year career break from Defra to train at Makers Academy (although I plan to find a job as a developer rather than returning).

#### NGO contract work (on career break from Government), Melbourne (2013 – 2014)
- Economic Adviser, [Australian Conservation Foundation](https://www.acf.org.au/) (Jun – Jul 2014)
- Research Fellow, [The Climate Institute](http://www.climateinstitute.org.au/) (Nov 2013 – Jul 2014)

Led a [study](http://www.climateinstitute.org.au/moving-below-zero.html) to understand the of role carbon-removal technologies in achieving climate goals. Analysed data, drafted reports, presented complex material at national conferences. Created blogs, videos, infographics, and web material.

## Interests
Outside work, I love to create things. Since I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by taking things apart and putting them back together again, and I love to teach myself new skills. Even when a junior economist, I built a complex model in my own time to escape time-consuming manual data processing, which changed the way the Government analyses climate targets. 

I’m a perfectionist about style and formatting which means I write code quickly and systematically, picking up errors. I also spend time on simple art and design and enjoy the crossover with programming and the functional design space. 

My hobbies include:

- **Holistic health** – mediation, yoga, triathlons
- **Art and design** – I paint and design and make clothes
- **Languages** – I speak conversational Spanish and am learning Portuguese
- **Coding meetups** – I regularly attend Codebar
