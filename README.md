## Clare Pinder

For eight years, I’ve enjoyed diverse roles as a Government economist. While I appreciate the variety, I’m happiest at work solving logic-based problems in Excel and statistical programmes. Even when a junior economist, I built a complex model in my own time to escape time-consuming manual data processing, which changed the way the Government analyses climate targets. 
 
Outside work, I love to create things. I’m fascinated by taking things apart and putting them back together again, and I love to teach myself new skills. I’m a perfectionist about style and formatting which means I write code quickly and systematically, picking up errors. I also spend time on simple art and design and enjoy the prospect of crossover with programming and the functional design space.
 
 [a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment. This has all led me to explore a move into the dynamic coding industry. I’ve been shadowing tech guys at work and speaking with individuals across various coding careers,
working through Codewars and have completed Codeacademy Ruby lessons. Through
this, I’ve started to get a picture of potential roles and initial thoughts about where my skills and interests would best fit.]

- In these roles, I led many high profile economic analyses to determine the effectiveness of proposed environmental policies, for example for recent announcement of plastics tax.
- I built analytical models (typically in Excel) to undertake quantitative analysis of large and incomplete datasets to determine both monetary and non-monetary costs and benefits. I did this both independently and delivering through my team. I researched and implemented innovative analytical techniques. 
- I managed projects, actively bringing in agile project management techniques into a traditional project management environment.
- I developed my oral and written communication skills through regularly presenting (to 100+ people), negotiating with Treasury in meetings, and briefing Ministers ensuring clear, concise and persuasive language.
- I have been rewarded with a year career break from Defra to do Makers Academy (but I intend not to return).
